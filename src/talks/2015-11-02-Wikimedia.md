# Wikimedia: The Twisted Road to RTL Support

## Summary

There are roughly 500 million speakers of Right-to-Left languages all over the world, and 16 RTL Wikipedias, but support of right-to-left languages on the Web in general is so abysmal that it is hard to find a single piece of software that properly supports all the necessary behaviors. And yet, that’s exactly what we’re committed on doing for Wikipedia’s right-to-left users.
This talk will demonstrate the challenges that the web poses for Right to Left languages, some of the solutions that are available, and some of the work we’ve been doing to make RTL users’ experience better.
